# Kaholo GitHub Webhook Trigger
Kaholo Triggers differ from ordinary Kaholo plugins in that they do nothing but listen and wait until some other event triggers them. Once triggered they begin the execution of a Kaholo pipeline.

This plugin adds a Trigger to Kaholo for [GitHub Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks). Webhooks allow you to set up integrations that subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. When one of those events is triggered, GitHub sends a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. For example, if somebody does a `git push` to the main repository, you might want to start a Kaholo pipeline to rebuild, test, and/or deploy the new code. Using GitHub Webhooks and this Kaholo Trigger plugin, that is easy to automate using Kaholo.

## Prerequisites
Apart from installing this plugin in your Kaholo Server, you will also need a GitHub account with sufficient access to your repositories to set up a [GitHub Webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks). If your Kaholo server is not exposed to the internet, you will also require sufficent network connectivity so GitHub can send an ***inbound HTTP POST*** to your Kaholo server. Otherwise in GitHub under "Recent Deliveries" you will see an error such as "We couldnâ€™t deliver this payload: failed to connect to host".

If your Kaholo server is not directly accessible from the internet, for example a local development or test system, or one self-hosted within a restrictive firewall, you may require some kind network trickery to use this plugin. For example [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). For a long-term solution it is recommended to work with your network administrator to get proper firewall/tunnel/forwarding rules in place to properly secure the connection.

## Plugin Installation
For download, installation, upgrade, downgrade and troubleshooting of plugins in general, see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## How to use:
Plugins are activated on a pipeline-by-pipeline basis in the Design page of the pipeline. Triggers are found there alongside Actions. Create a new trigger and give it a name, optional description and configuration, and select GitHub Trigger from drop-down list of plugins.

There are two supported methods - GitHub Push and GitHub Pull Request. Push should be used for a pipeline you wish to run every time code is pushed to a repo, and Pull Request is for pipelines that run only whenever there is a new Pull Request. More details on these configuration can be found below.

Either method includes both a Webhook (Payload URL) and a Secret (string in Kaholo Vault). For example `https://myusername.kaholo.net/webhook/github/push` and `mysecretstring`. These two are required for the GitHub WebHook end of the configuration. Both `json` and `x-www-form-urlencoded` application types are supported, as well as SSL verification. For more details please see the [GitHub Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks) documentation.

Once configured, actions in GitHub triggering the webhook will result in a "Recent Delivery" in GitHub. If the delivery was successful, the event will get a green checkmark representing HTTP 200 (Success). On the Kaholo side, if the webhook matches the Kaholo trigger configuration, the Kaholo pipeline will be started. The Executions panel in Execution Results will also show it was triggered by "Trigger: Github myrepo main branch Pu...", and not for example "Started manually by user Soe Andso."

## Micromatch patterns
Micromatch patterns are not the same as regex. For detailed information about how micromatch works, see the [micromatch README.md](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch). Here are simple examples that will fit most situations:

To match only branch `release`:

    release

To match branches beginning with `dev`:

    dev*

To match tags containing `"rc"`:

    *rc*

## Method: GitHub Push:
This trigger expects an HTTP POST whenever there is a push to a repository. This can mean either a branch push or a tag push.

### Webhook
The webhook URL that should be provided on the GitHub end as "Payload URL" is **{KAHOLO_URL}/webhook/github/push**. For example if Kaholo is at `https://tfv610c.kaholodemo.net`, the webhook should POST to:

    https://tfv610c.kaholodemo.net/webhook/github/push

### Parameter: Webhook Secret
This is the GitHub "Secret", a string in the Kaholo Vault that must match that sent by the GitHub webhook in order to be effective. If none is provided, any secret or no secret at all on the GitHub side may trigger the pipeline.

### Parameter: Repository Name
The name of the repository to watch for push events. If not specified, then pushes to any repository may trigger the Kaholo pipeline.

### Parameter: Branch Pattern
The branch or branch [micromatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) to filter. If not specified, a push to any branch may trigger the pipeline.

### Parameter: Tag Pattern
The tag or tag [micromatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) to filter. If not specified, a push to any tag may trigger the pipeline.

## Method: GitHub Pull Request
This trigger expects an HTTP POST whenever there is an action performed on a pull request in GitHub.

### Webhook
The webhook URL that should be provided on the GitHub end as "Payload URL" is **{KAHOLO_URL}/webhook/github/pr**. For example if Kaholo is at `https://tfv610c.kaholodemo.net`, the webhook should POST to:

    https://tfv610c.kaholodemo.net/webhook/github/pr

### Parameter: Webhook Secret
This is the GitHub "Secret", a string in the Kaholo Vault that must match that sent by the GitHub webhook in order to be effective. If none is provided, any secret or no secret at all on the GitHub side may trigger the pipeline.

### Parameter: Repository Name
The name of the repository to watch for pull request events. If not specified, then pull requests in any repository may trigger the Kaholo pipeline.

### Parameter: Target Branch
The branch or branch [micromatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) to filter the branch targeted. If not specified, a pull request to any branch may trigger the pipeline. This is the branch that corresponds to `pull_request.base.ref` in the GitHub payload.

### Parameter: Source Branch
The branch or branch [micromatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) to filter the branch sourced. If not specified, a pull request from any branch may trigger the pipeline. This is the branch that corresponds to `pull_request.head.ref` in the GitHub payload.

### Parameter: Trigger on Action
Use this to select the specific action(s) that will cause the pipeline to be triggered. Options are: 
* Any (any and every pull request action)
* Opened
* Merged
* Declined
* Reopened
* Assigned
* Review Requested
* Review Request Removed
* Labeled
* Unlabeled
* Synchronize

## Method: GitHub Release
This trigger expects an HTTP POST whenever there is a release event. This means the header x-github-event is "release". It will also trigger on a specific action if selected.

### Webhook
The webhook URL that should be provided on the GitHub end as "Payload URL" is **{KAHOLO_URL}/webhook/github/release**. For example if Kaholo is at `https://tfv610c.kaholodemo.net`, the webhook is at:

    https://tfv610c.kaholodemo.net/webhook/github/release

### Parameter: Webhook Secret
This is the GitHub "Secret", a string in the Kaholo Vault that must match that sent by the GitHub webhook in order to be effective. If none is provided, any secret or no secret at all on the GitHub side may trigger the pipeline.

### Parameter: Repository Name
The name of the repository to watch for release events. If not specified, then releases in any repository may trigger the Kaholo pipeline.

### Parameter: Event Action
Use this to select the specific action(s) that will cause the pipeline to be triggered. A new release typically sends three requests - `release.created`, `release.published`, and `release.released`. Options are: 
* Any (any and every release action)
* Created
* Edited
* Deleted
* Released
* Prereleased
* Unpublished
* Published
